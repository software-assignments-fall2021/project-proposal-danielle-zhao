# Project Proposal


# Street Eats

# What and why?
I want to create an app for food carts and trucks to advertise their businesses.When it comes to looking up food online, a user who doesn't know what's around is rarely offered cart food options on sites like Yelp or through a quick Google search. Having an app for this will create a more centralized location to find food trucks/carts.  


# For whom?
This product is hopefully going to be really useful for street food vendors as it will increase their visibility. It will also be helpful for users on the otherside; people who are looking for food options.

# How?
There will be two sides to this app - the business/vendor side and the user side. Food trucks/carts will be able to input their hours, location, contact, and menu and create a listing. They can also classify themselves by cuisine, budget, and other characteristics. On the other hand, users will be able to create user profiles which they can use to search for food options. They can also post reviews or rate the businesses, add photos, and more. 

# Scope
The scope of this project can be flexible - I could think of more features to add, but at the very least there should be the ability for businesses to create a listing with useful information and users to create profiles. This should not betoo complex to complete within the semester.
